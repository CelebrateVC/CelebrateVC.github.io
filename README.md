#### Modifiers

Good things to look out for 
* Resistances (Fire, Cold, Lightning, All Elemental Res, Chaos)
* Movement Speed ( for boots and only boots )
* Balance of +X added (more/less) and Y% increased/reduced `(base+added)*(1+increased)`

Considerations
1) Tier (1 [best] - 9 )
2) Roll 
3) Local (affects this item and things done with this item) vs Global (affects the character)
